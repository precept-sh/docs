<!-- ## Why Precept? -->

Managing multiple third-party API integrations is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone.

Precept provides a single, unified interface that handles all the complexity of API integration for you.

Enabling features that would take months to build in-house has always been the promise of third-party integrations. But often the integration takes just as long, distracting your team from doing what you really need them to do.
